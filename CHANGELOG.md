# Changelog

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **Nginx Streams (TCP/UDP) support**: 7 new MCP tools — `npm_list_streams`,
  `npm_get_stream`, `npm_create_stream`, `npm_update_stream`, `npm_delete_stream`,
  `npm_enable_stream`, `npm_disable_stream` — backed by the `/nginx/streams` API endpoints.
- **CLI parity for streams**: new `stream` command group in `npm-cli` and
  `*-stream` commands in `npm-direct` (list/get/create/update/delete/enable/disable).
- Unit tests for stream tool registration and schema, plus integration tests covering
  the full stream lifecycle (create → get → update → enable/disable → delete).

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-17

### Fixed
- **Certificate ID validation**: Fixed type validation issue where numeric certificate IDs in JSON parameters were causing errors. Now properly handles numbers, numeric strings, and the special "new" value.
- **Access List expansion error**: Added graceful fallback when server returns 500 error with expand parameter. The tool now automatically retries without expansion and notifies the user.
- **Audit Log pagination**: Added pagination support to handle large audit logs that exceed token limits. New optional `limit` and `offset` parameters control the response size.
- **Dead Host boolean handling**: Fixed boolean type inconsistency where dead hosts expect numeric values (0/1) instead of true/false. Boolean values are now automatically converted.
